## Plan

| Item | Description | Achieve time |
| :--- | :---------- | :----------- |
| Multi-language Support | All texts as part of UI should be moved out of source code. Program reads language file on initiation. | Before Nov 2020 |
| Changeable map size | Map size becomes a changeable gamerule. | Before 2021 |
| Keyboard Event | Although mouse interaction support is a feature, most process can't be done with keyboard only. What's more, a console isn't designed to receive mouse event. The goal is to make all process possible to be done using only keyboard. | ? |

As I'm currently a high school student, I don't always have access to computer, so issues may not be handled in time.
